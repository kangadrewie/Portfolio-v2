## Personal Portfolio V2



Personal Portfolio website created with ReactJS. When I started this project, I wanted to create a hub for all my work. To achieve this I needed to build in a Project Showcase that would allow a user to access my source files for my work. Using GitHub api, I built a file explorer that makes requests to me latest Github commit and returns the content, without asking the user to leave the page.

## TODOS
    - Use github webhooks to keep portfolio up to date
    - Implement react-router for routing between projects
    - Improve SEO using react-helmet and sitemap.xml
    - Allow project descriptions to repo markdown
