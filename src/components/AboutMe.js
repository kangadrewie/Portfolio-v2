I’ve a strong desire to learn and grow my skillset in an industry that I am extremely enthusiastic about. I’m currently focused on developing my knowledge in backend development, but having worked as a Graphic Designer for 5 years, I have a keen eye for detail, design, symmetry, and colour and enjoy applying these skills to Front-End Development. I’m a fast learner, and firmly believe in the importance of interaction, feedback, and collaboration in the creative problem-solving process. '
