Before this, I worked as a Graphic Designer for a busy design studio in Dublin, and was most recently employed as an Employment Advisor responsible for managing a large client portfolio on behalf of the Department of Employment Affairs and Protection. However, over the course of the last 12 months, I have developed skills and knowledge in many area of Software Engineering, and am actively driven to continue exploring new technologies and concepts daily."
